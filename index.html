            <p>"The Black Cat" is one of Edgar Allan Poe's most memorable stories. The tale centers around a
                black cat and the subsequent deterioration of a man. The story is often linked with "The Tell-Tale
                Heart"
                because of the profound psychological elements these two works share.</p>
