            <p>Orphaned Heidi lives with her gruff but caring grandfather on the side of Swiss mountain, where
                she befriends young Peter the goat-herd. She leads an idyllic life, until she is forced to leave
                the mountain she has always known to go and live with a sickly girl in the city. Will Heidi ever
                see her grandfather again? A classic tale of a young girl's coming-of-age, of friendship, and familial
                love.</p>

            <p>More than a hundred years ago, Oscar Wilde created this moving story for his children, The Happy Prince:
                a story of friendship, love, and a willingness to part with one's own riches may be more important today
                than ever before. This volume also includes four more of Wilde's most treasured stories, like "The
                Selfish Giant" or "The Nightingale and the Rose". Often whimsical and sometimes sad, they all shine with
                poetry and magic.
